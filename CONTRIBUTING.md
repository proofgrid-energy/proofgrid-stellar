# Contributing

Use Node 24+ and npm. Clone this repository, run npm ci, then npm test and npm run demo. In PowerShell use npm.cmd. Each repository works without sibling checkouts; vendored core artifacts are deliberate pinned captures.

Open a focused proposal or choose a task in docs/backlog.md. Explain the actual problem, scope, expected behavior and acceptance check. Agree source/schema changes before broad implementation. Do not create activity merely for bounty points.

Keep commits coherent. Pull requests should explain behavior, include relevant positive/negative tests and record actual command results. Do not alter unrelated code, generated lockfiles by hand, or license notices. Generated code remains the contributor's responsibility; understand and review it. Maintainers review source correctness, tests, privacy and compatibility before merging.

Keep records, salts and signing secrets off-chain. Testnet demos must use synthetic records and ephemeral keys. Live network tests are opt-in and do not run in ordinary CI.

New source uses MPL-2.0; preserve earlier Apache notices. Contributors retain their copyright. No CLA or attribution trailer is required by this project. Do not include private customer data, production credentials or manufacturer documents without a supported redistribution basis.
